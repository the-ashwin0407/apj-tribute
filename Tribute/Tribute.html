                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    In 1969, he moved to the Indian
                    Space Research Organisation, where he
                    was project director of the SLV-III, the
                    first satellite launch vehicle that was
                    both designed and produced in India.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                    Kalam planned the program that produced
                    a number of successful missiles, which
                    helped earn him the nickname <strong>Missile Man.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Among those successes
                    was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                    ballistic missile, which incorporated
                    aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                    in 1989.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He also played a
                     pivotal organisational, technical,
                    and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                    nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                    the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
                    was scientific adviser to the defense
                    minister, and he later served as principal
                    scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
                    government with the rank of cabinet minister.

                    His prominent role in
                    the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                    solidified India as a nuclear power and
                    established Kalam as a national hero,
                    although the tests caused great concern
                    in the international community.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1998 Kalam put
                    forward a countrywide plan called <b>
                    Technology Vision 2020</b>, which he described
                    as a road map for transforming India from
                    a less-developed to a developed society
                    in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                    other measures, increasing agricultural
                    productivity, emphasizing technology as
                    a vehicle for economic growth, and
                    widening access to health care and
                    education.
